Shortcuts: Ctrl+Enter for new item, Alt+D to mark as done

Weapons:
  ☐ *Sword:* General broad area damage, a good medium between damage and affected area
  ☐ *Bow and Arrow:* Decent damage, aimed to sit back and slowly chip away at enemies, more strategic placement
  ☐ *Knuckle busters:* Terrible damage, but lots of hits, players would pick this to run in apply lots of buff stacks and then run out, I want this to require a lot of skill and loss strategy but planning
  ☐ *Spear:* Good targetted damage, have a longer lunge area than the sword

Buffs:
  ☐ *Magma:* You leave a trail of pools/puddles that damage people when they standing on it
  ☐ *Shock:* Upon taking more damage, chains of electricity are applied to surrounding enemies (don't chain, just immediate)
    With Shock, if two enemies have shock applied then they can infact have an infinite loop of applying shock. For the time being I am happy with this functionality
  ☐ *Freeze:* Slowed down movement and attack
  ☐ *Rooted:* Unable to move but can attack
  ☐ *Shielded:* Reduced damage applied

Artifacts:
  ☐ *Battery* -> Applies shock to hits
  ☐ *Health Kit* -> Activating your ability heals you
  ☐ *Touch of Cold* -> All attacks now apply a stack of freeze
  ☐ *Leach* - When you are near an enemy you can steal some of their health

Enemies:
  ☐ *Knight:* Simple medium moving speed, decent health, single downward strike
